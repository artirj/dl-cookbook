# The Deep Learning Cookbook

We all know and love the [Matrix Cookbook](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/views/edoc_download.php/3274/pdf/imm3274.pdf), and now the world also has a Deep Learning Cookbook!

This repo will contain simple recipes to achieve given goals using (Deep) Neural Networks. Some code implementations in keras will be made available.

So here I will talk about convnets, batch normalisation, LSTM, GRU, dropout, pseudolabelling, different optimisers, style transfer, text generation, GANs, and more!

You can contribute to this repo if you want.

## Predict data using a linear model

Use ~~linear regression~~ a single layer perceptron. This will be a simple function that multiplies your inputs by a weight matrix and outputs that.

# Regularising a neural network

# What gradient descent optimiser should I use?

Short answer: Adam.
Long answer: read [this](http://sebastianruder.com/optimizing-gradient-descent/) and [this](https://medium.com/slavv/picking-an-optimizer-for-style-transfer-86e7b8cba84b#.mm98exrzp)
