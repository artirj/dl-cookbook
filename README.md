# The Deep Learning Cookbook

We all know and love the [Matrix Cookbook](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/views/edoc_download.php/3274/pdf/imm3274.pdf), and now the world also has a Deep Learning Cookbook!

This repo will contain simple recipies to achieve given goals using (Deep) Neural Networks. Some code implementations in keras will be made available.

## Predict data using a linear model

Use ~~linear regression~~ a single layer perceptron. This will be a simple function that multiplies your inputs by a weight matrix and outputs that.

# Regularising a neural network
